1. How many system calls does each method make?
- System Call Method (openat -> read -> read -> close): had 4 calls for reading /proc/version
- Library Method (fopen/fgets/fclose): 0 because it crashed (SIGSEGV) before it was able to do the file reading calls

2. What's the difference between fopen() and open()?
- open(): opens a file using the OS interface and returns a int file descriptor
- fopen(): opens a file using C library and returns "FILE*" stream (basically buffered, higher level)

3. Why does the library method make different system calls?
- I think it's because C's library adds buffering and stream management so it might've done extra or different syscalls (reads, metadata checks, etc) 
  compared to directly calling open/read/close

Comfortability score [ 5 / 5 ]
Completeness score [ 5 / 5 ]

A win: Managed to run the program on Linux (got new laptop that can handle Ubuntu yay!) and learned how to use strace to see system calls. 
Helped me see the difference between low level sys calls and higher level library funcs when accessing files through /proc.
